This is a small collection of a few of my (relatively) recently generated favorite figures.

## GSL deep brine layer
Salinities in Gilbert Bay of Great Salt Lake (GSL) for surface (<=1 m) and bottom (>=4 m) samples. Data extracted from USGS NWIS.  
  
This shows the existence, dissipation, and reformation of a deep brine layer (DBL) as a result of modifications made to a 
railroad causeway that bisects the main body of GSL and dictates the hyrdologic connectivity between Gilbert and Gunnison Bays of GSL. 
A DBL was present from 2010-2014 when Gilbert and Gunnison Bays were connected through culverts in the railroad causeway. 
The DBL was observable at two sites with the northern site (2601) showing higher salinity than the southern site (5601). 
Following culvert closure (2014-2017), The DBL dissipated (2014-2017) following the closure of the connecting culverts, and surface salinities in Gilbert Bay increased. The DBL reformed in summer/fall 2017 following the opening of a new causeway breach. 
Surface salinities in Gilbert Bay decreased by about 40 g/L (4 percent) following the causeway breach opening.

## GSL salinity shifts
Changes over time in salinity in Gilbert Bay of GSL. Data from Utah Geological Survey.  
Salinity in Gilbert Bay is a function of the total salt pool available and the volume of the bay. To generate this figure, I modeled the historic (pre-1985) 
salinity:water surface elevation (as a proxy for volume) relationship, predicted expected salinities under historic conditions for all sampling events, then plotted observed minus expected salinities. This removes the effect of fluctuating lake 
levels in interpreting changes in salinity over time. Values greater than zero reflect more saline conditions and values less than zero reflect less saline than expected conditions. 
Higher than expected salinities in the late 1980s and early 1990s may have resulted from unusually high connectivity between Gilbert and Gunnison Bays under a period of historic flooding. The decline in observed minus expected salinities since 
that period suggests a progressive freshening of Gilbert Bay.

## Jordanelle Reservoir stratification
Intense thermal stratification of a deep (up to 80 meters) reservoir in Utah, Jordanelle Reservoir. Data from [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/){target="_blank"}.  
In spite of the intense stratification, Jordanelle does occasionally turn over and fully mix with mixing events observed in 
April of 2016, 2017, and 2018.

## Ashley Creek TDS
Spatial variation in total dissolved solids (TDS) in streams in the Ashley Creek watershed, Utah. Data from [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/){target="_blank"}.  
TDS increases in a downstream direction reflecting a shift from high elevation, forested watersheds to a valley agricultural watershed. Switch the baselayer from topo to satellite to see the changes in land use.
