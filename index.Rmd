# About me
I am an environmental scientist and aquatic ecologist working in the water quality field. I grew up in Michigan and attended Northern Michigan University where I earned my B.S. in 
Environmental Science. I subsequently moved out to Logan, Utah and earned an M.S. in Aquatic Ecology at Utah State University. Following my M.S., I stayed at USU and worked as a 
research associate, conducting research in stream ecology, biodiversity, and biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems. I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah, working in the
Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality, where I work to develop and implement water quality standards for the state of Utah and provide 
technical expertise in water quality data analysis.    

I have particular interests in data analysis at large spatial and temporal scales and in connecting different data types to build a more complete picture of our environment. 
I also have a penchant for data visualization and enjoy the challenge of boiling down complicated, intertwined processes to their core components and communicating them in 
understandable figures.  

The bulk of my technical work is based in the R statistical language which I use to develop analytical tools (i.e. functions, packages, & visualizations), perform analyses, and 
build interactive data applications.  

Figures and interpretations on this page reflect my own personal interpretations and do not represent any official position.
